RTSP-Server version
========================

This module is designed to accept a number of sources to connect and
transmit audio and video streams.
Clients can connect and send RTSP commands to receive RTP data.

This was designed to make rebroadcasting audio and video data over a
network simple.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

RUNNING

Simply fire up the included rtsp-server.pl application and it will
listen for clients on port 554 (standard RTSP port), and source
streams on port 5545.

To begin sending video, you can use any client which supports the
ANNOUNCE and RECORD RTSP methods, such as ffmpeg:

ffmpeg -re -i /input.avi -f rtsp -muxdelay 0.1 rtsp://12.34.56.78:5545/abc

You should then be able to play that stream with any decent media
player. Just point it at rtsp://12.34.56.78/abc

If you don't want to run it as root, you may specify non-priviliged
ports with --clientport/-c and --sourceport/-s

COMING SOON:

Priv dropping, authentication, client encoder, stats, tests
